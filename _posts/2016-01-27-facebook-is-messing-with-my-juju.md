How
is it that five minutes after I check out hotels on

www.hotels.com

,
Facebook and the website post it on my news feed to give me another chance to
book a room there? Mind you, I do not follow 

www.hotels.com

.
However, my friend Fred does. So it shows up as "Fred likes . . . " and then there's
a post showing the hotel in Auckland I'm thinking about booking for my son in
August. 

What
the hell, Facebook? I'm sure someone could explain to me how this works -- not
that I'd 100% get it, mind you -- but I still think it's creepy. And this happens
to me all the time, as I suspect it must to you and everybody else on Facebook.
Looking at refrigerators at Lowe's? Well, son of a gun. There's an ad for
Lowe's refrigerators on your Facebook page the next time you check in searching
for cute cat videos or witty sayings (and where do THOSE all come from?) posted
by your friends.

On
the right of the Facebook news feed is a column called "Trending." Now, I'm
under the impression, though perhaps incorrectly, that what you see and what I
see in that column may differ, as well. Is that true? Anybody? Anybody?
Bueller? 

If
it is true, then I have no idea why Facebook would share that particular batch
of "trending" informational links with me. I have given them no reason to
believe I care about Britney Spears on looking fit in her bikini on vacation
somewhere or other. Honestly. Don't care. Steven Colbert making fun of Sarah
Palin? Maybe. I'll give them that. But Britney or Real Housewives or the
Kardashians (are they all related somehow?)? Nope. I will not be clicking on
those links. Never. How can Facebook be so right about Lowe's and wrong about
"news?"

There
was one piece of "trending" information I wanted to share today. Did you know that
R. Kelly questions the veracity of testimonies of all the women who accused
Bill Cosby of sexually assaulting them?

I
have several problems with this trending news, Facebook.

First,
who is R. Kelly? 

Okay.
So I looked him up and the 

[][0][][0]_GQ_

article
called him "a singer who catapulted to fame in the 90s and 2000s with songs
like Bump and Grind and Ignition." Oh. That R. Kelly. The songs aren't familiar
to me, but then, I'm old and hip hop and rap just don't appeal to me. I do,
however, like the Black Keys and Arctic Monkeys, to name a few, so I'm not
totally trapped in a 60s time warp, if I do say so.

Second,
why is R. Kelly considered any kind of expert on the Cosby allegations and why
would 

_GQ_

even ask him? 

Well,
I discovered that it came up in an interview because R. Kelly himself has been accused
of child pornography and other sexual mishaps, shall we say. Kelly was found
not guilty when the main witness refused to testify. In fact, Kelly settled a
number of charges of accused sexual relations with minors out of court, but not
surprisingly, he claims that they all were lying.

Okay.
Fine. Not my story today.

What
is interesting -- and amusing -- to me is that Kelly reportedly said, about the
Cosby horror show, "When I look on TV and see the 70-, 80-, 90-year-old ladies
talking about what happened when they were 17, 18, or 19, there's something
strange about it." He also stated, "If God showed me they were telling the
truth, I would say that's wrong."

I'm
not sure I saw anyone on TV in her 80s or 90s, since Cosby did prefer them
young, but what our friend R seems unable to grasp is that one day the little
hotties he's chasing today will be, God willing, in their 70s, 80s and 90s,
too. There have been hotties since the world began. Just the outfits and hair
styles have changed. Well, and morals may flex from one decade to another.

As
for God communicating directly with R. Kelly -- no comment.

While
I don't understand how they do it, I do understand why Facebook wants to show
me hotel rooms and refrigerators and such. What I don't understand is why
Facebook or any other entity in the free world, for that matter, would be
interested in whether or not R. Kelly thinks Bill Cosby was a dickwad who
drugged and raped a bunch of women. Is it somehow relevant that one dickwad is
expressing solidarity with another one? Now, if Pope Francis thinks Bill
couldn't have done it, I might be willing to reconsider.

I
don't CARE what R. Kelly thinks, Facebook. Nor do I care what Britney Spears
wore to the beach or who Chloe Kardashian is dating. If you are in any way
tailoring your trending news to my tastes, you are way off the mark. Just
wanted to let you know.

And
while I'm at it, would Yahoo! please stop calling that crap on its home page
"news?" Vicki What's-her-face from the "Real Housewives of Orange County" is
usually the lead story. Seriously?

And
I'll stop here before I'm tempted to take a crack at Fox News.
